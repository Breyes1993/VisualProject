# VisualProject
Project Proposal

Our team will create a graph visualizing the average of the top leading causes of death in the United States and how they alternate since 1900-2015. The top 5 causes of death in our dataset are stroke, heart disease, influenza/pneumonia, cancer, and accidents. The axis will represent a timeline, and the Y-axis will represent the death rate of each cause of death.
